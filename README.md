TurboMineSweeper
================

Mid semester high school project that uses a depth first outward expansion algorithm (discovered a completely unknown fact about recursion at the time!) to play a game of minesweeper with a 9X9 mine map. 

Named "TurboMineSweeper" to show the fact that this project was initially programmed in the compiler cum IDE known as Turbo C++ (:D) MS-DOS :D :D
